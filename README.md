# little-chores

Little Chores is a child-friendly task and reward web application designed to help parents encourage positive habits through age-appropriate chores.
The application supports parents in managing tasks for their children while motivating children through positive reinforcement using stickers and encouraging feedback.

## Project Goals

- The application is designed to help parents understand the importance of involving children in everyday chores in an age-appropriate way, while learning about the benefits these activities have on children’s development.
- It also allows parents to safely suggest new tasks without immediate public visibility, helping to keep parents engaged in their children’s physical learning journey.
- All shared tasks are reviewed and approved by an admin to ensure they remain safe and appropriate.
- The application supports children through positive reinforcement of good habits.
- A simple and accessible interface is maintained to support daily family use.
